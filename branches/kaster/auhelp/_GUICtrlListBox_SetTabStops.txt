The integers in $aTabStops represent the number of quarters of the average character width for the font that
is selected into the list box. For example, a tab stop of 4 is placed at 1.0 character units, and a tab stop
of 6 is placed at 1.5 average character units. However, if the list box is part of a dialog box, the integers
are in dialog template units. The tab stops must be sorted in ascending order; backward tabs are not allowed.
