$sMessage
	The string that is displayed in the message box

---  Примечания  ---
An application calls FatalAppExit only when it is not capable of terminating any other way. FatalAppExit may
not always free an application's memory or close its files, and it may cause a general failure of the system.
An application that encounters an unexpected error should terminate by freeing all its memory and returning
from its main message loop.
