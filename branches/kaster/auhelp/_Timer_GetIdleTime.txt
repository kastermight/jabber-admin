Успех:	integer ticks since last (approx. milliseconds) since last activity
Ошибка:	Sets @extended = 1 if rollover occurs (see remarks)

---  Примечания  ---
The current ticks since last system restart will roll over to 0 every 50 days or so,
which makes it possible for last user activity to be before the rollover, but run time
of this function to be after the rollover. If this happens, @extended = 1 and the
returned value is ticks since rollover occured.
