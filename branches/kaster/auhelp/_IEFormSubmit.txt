---  Примечания  ---
For many HTML forms it is not sufficient to use _IEFormSubmit() because there is often custom JavaScript tied to an onClick event for its Submit button.  In these cases you'll need to simulate a click of the submit button instead of using _IEFormSubmit().  See the example for the "click" action of _IEAction().
As well, some form processing relies on the "value" of the submit button being passed along with the rest of the form data (often when there is more than one submit button in the form and they are designed to trigger different results).  This function will not result in a submit button value being passed.  The solution is to use the "click" action of _IEAction() as above.
If you experience trouble with the automatic _IELoadWait called by default, please set $f_wait parameter to 0 and call _IELoadWait from your script, passing it the InternetExplorer object.
