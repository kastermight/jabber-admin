	Handle to the window to be removed from the chain.
		The handle must have been passed to the _ClipBoard_SetClipboardViewer function.

	Handle to the window that follows the $hRemove window in the clipboard viewer chain.
		This is the handle returned by _ClipBoard_SetViewer, unless the sequence was changed in response to a $WM_CHANGECBCHAIN message.

The window identified by $hNewNext replaces the $hRemove window in the chain. The _ClipBoard_SetViewer function
sends a $WM_CHANGECBCHAIN message to the first window in the clipboard viewer chain.
