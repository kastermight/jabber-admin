
_GUICtrlTab_SetCurFocus

Sets the focus to a specified tab

#Include 
_GUICtrlTab_SetCurFocus($hWnd, $iIndex)

---  Таблица параметров  ---
$hWnd
	Handle to the control
$iIndex
	Zero based item index

---  Примечания  ---
If the tab control has the $TCS_BUTTONS style (button mode), the tab with the focus may be
different from the selected tab. For example, when a tab is selected, the user can press the
arrow keys to set the focus to a different tab without changing the selected tab. In button
mode, $TCM_SETCURFOCUS sets the input focus to the button associated with the specified tab,
but it does not change the selected tab.

If the tab control does not have the $TCS_BUTTONS style, changing the focus also changes the selected tab.
