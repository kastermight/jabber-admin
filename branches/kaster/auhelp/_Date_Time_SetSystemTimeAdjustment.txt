$iAdjustment
	The number of 100 nanosecond units added to the time of day clock at each clock interrupt if
		periodic time adjustment is enabled.
$fDisabled
	A value of True specifies that periodic time adjustment is to be disabled. The system is free
		to adjust time of day using its own internal mechanisms. The system's internal adjustment mechanisms may
		cause the time-of-day clock to jump noticeably when adjustments are made. A value of False specifies that
		periodic time adjustment is to be enabled, and will be used to adjust the time of day clock. The system will
		not interfere with the time adjustment scheme, and will not attempt to synchronize time of day on its own.
		The system will add the value of iAdjustment to the time of day at each clock interrupt.
