$hWnd
	Handle to the window to be flashed. The window can be either open or minimized.
$fInvert
	[опционально] If True, the window is flashed from one state to the other. If False the window is returned to
		its original state. When an application is minimized and this parameter is True, the taskbar window button
		flashes active/inactive. If it is False, the taskbar window button flashes inactive, meaning that it does
		not change colors. It flashes as if it were being redrawn, but it does not provide the visual invert clue to
		the user.
