Use ObjCreate() if you want to have a new instance of the referring application.
If you want to connect to an existing process, use ObjGet() instead.

Keep in mind that not all computers have the same set of Objects. So always check for errors after calling ObjCreate(). 

The following requirements apply if you want to access objects on remote computers:
-The user running the script must have the appropriate permissions.
-The Object on the remote computer must support DCOM (Distributed COM)
-The remote computer must have 'Remote Registry Service' and 'File and Printer sharing' services running.

See the Obj/COM Reference for more information about Objects.
