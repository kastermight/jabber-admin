$iAccess
	Access mask that specifies the requested types of access to the access token. These requested
		access types are reconciled against the token's discretionary access control list (DACL) to determine which
		accesses are granted or denied.
$hThread
	[опционально] Handle to the thread whose access token is opened
$fOpenAsSelf
	[опционально] Indicates whether the access check is to be made against the security context of the thread
		calling the OpenThreadToken function or against the security context of the process for the calling thread.
		If this parameter is False, the access check is performed using the security context for the calling thread.
		If the thread is impersonating a client, this security context can be that of a client process. If this
		parameter is True, the access check is made using the security context of the process for the calling thread.
