	Identifies a logical pen, brush, font, bitmap, region, or palette
$iSize
	Specifies the number of bytes to be written to the buffer
$pObject
	Pointer to a buffer that receives the information. The following shows the type of information
		the buffer receives for each type of graphics object you can specify:
		HBITMAP - BITMAP or DIBSECTION
		HPALETTE - A count of the number of entries in the logical palette
		HPEN - EXTLOGPEN or LOGPEN
		HBRUSH - LOGBRUSH
		HFONT - LOGFONT

		If $pObject is 0 the function return value is the number of bytes required to store the information it writes
		to the buffer for the specified graphics object.

Успех:	If $pObject is a valid pointer, the return value is the number of bytes stored into the buffer.
	If the function succeeds, and $pObject is 0, the return value is the number of bytes required to hold the information the function would store into the buffer.
