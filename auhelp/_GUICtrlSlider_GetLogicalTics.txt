Успех: Returns array logical positions
Ошибка: @error is set

---  Примечания  ---
The number of elements in the array is two less than the tick count returned by the
_GUICtrlSlider_GetNumTics function. Note that the values in the array may include duplicate
positions and may not be in sequential order. The data in the returned array is valid until
you change the slider's tick marks

The elements of the array specify the logical positions of the sliders's tick marks, not including
the first and last tick marks created by the slider. The logical positions can be any of the integer
values in the sliders's range of minimum to maximum slider positions.
