Unloads SQLite.dll

#include 
_SQLite_Shutdown ( )

None.

---  Примечания  ---
If _SQLite_Startup() failed or was not executed, an AutoIt runtime error will be thrown, and the script will terminate!
AutoIt automatically closes any dlls it opened, but calling _SQLite_Shutdown is still a good idea.
