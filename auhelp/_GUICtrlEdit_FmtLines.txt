A soft line break consists of two carriage returns and a line feed and is inserted at the
end of a line that is broken because of wordwrapping.

This function affects only the text returned by the _GUICtrlEdit_GetText function.

It has no effect on the display of the text within the edit control.

The _GUICtrlEdit_FmtLines function does not affect a line that ends with a hard line break.
A hard line break consists of one carriage return and a line feed.
