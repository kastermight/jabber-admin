This function creates a logical font with the characteristics specified in the $tagLOGFONT structure. When this
font is selected by using the SelectObject function, GDI's font mapper attempts to match the logical font with
an existing physical font. If it fails to find an exact match it provides an alternative whose characteristics
match as many of the requested characteristics as possible.
