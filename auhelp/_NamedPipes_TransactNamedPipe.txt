---  Таблица параметров  ---
$hNamedPipe
	The handle to the named pipe
$pInpBuf
	Pointer to the buffer containing the data to be written to the pipe
$iInpSize
	Size of the write buffer, in bytes
$pOutBuf
	Pointer to the buffer that receives the data read from the pipe
$iOutSize
	Size of the read buffer, in bytes
$pOverlapped
	[опционально] Pointer to a $tagOVERLAPPED structure. This structure is required if hNamedPipe was opened with
		$FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED. If hNamedPipe was opened with $FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, pOverlapped must not be 0. If
		hNamedPipe was opened with $FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and pOverlapped is not 0, TransactNamedPipe is executed as
		an overlapped operation. The $tagOVERLAPPED structure should contain a manual reset event object. If the
		operation cannot be completed immediately, TransactNamedPipe returns False and GetLastError will return
		ERROR_IO_PENDING.

TransactNamedPipe fails if the server did not create the pipe as a message-type pipe or if the pipe handle is
not in message-read mode.
