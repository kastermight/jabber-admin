Returns an Array with the following format:
	[1] - The number of 100 nanosecond units added to the clock at each periodic time adjustment
	[2] - The number of 100 nanosecond units between periodic time adjustments. This interval is the time period
	between a system's clock interrupts.		[3] - True indicates that periodic time adjustment is disabled. At each clock interrupt, the system merely
	adds the interval between clock interrupts to the clock. If False, periodic time adjustment is being used to		adjust the clock.
