---  Примечания  ---
The window region of a window is set by calling the SetWindowRgn function.
The window region determines the area within the window where the system permits drawing.
The system does not display any portion of a window that lies outside of the window region
The coordinates of a window's window region are relative to the upper-left corner of the window, not the client area of the window.
To set the window region of a window, call the SetWindowRgn function.
