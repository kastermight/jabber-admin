#Include 
_GUICtrlTreeView_CreateDragImage($hWnd, $hItem)

---  Таблица параметров  ---
$hWnd
	Handle to the control
$hItem
	Handle to the item

---  Таблица возвращаемых значений  ---
Успех:	The image list handle to which the dragging bitmap was added
Ошибка:	0

---  Примечания  ---
If you create the control without an associated image list, you cannot use this function to create the image
to display during a drag operation. You must implement your own method of creating a drag cursor. You are
responsible for destroying the image list when it is no longer needed.
