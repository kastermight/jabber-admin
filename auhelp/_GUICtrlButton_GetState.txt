Успех: The current state of the button. You can use the following values to extract information about the state:
		  $BST_CHECKED - Indicates the button is checked.
		  $BST_FOCUS - Specifies the focus state. A nonzero value indicates that the button has the keyboard focus.
		  $BST_INDETERMINATE - Indicates the button is grayed because the state of the button is indeterminate.
		    This value applies only if the button has the $BS_3STATE or $BS_AUTO3STATE style.
		  $BST_PUSHED - Specifies the highlight state. A nonzero value indicates that the button is highlighted.
		    A button is automatically highlighted when the user positions the cursor over it and presses and holds the
		    left mouse button. The highlighting is removed when the user releases the mouse button.
		  $BST_UNCHECKED - Indicates the button is cleared. Same as a return value of zero.
