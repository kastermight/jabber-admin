---  Таблица возвращаемых значений  ---
Успех:	Sound Position
Ошибка:	0 and set @error
@error:	1 = $iMode is invalid
	3 = Invalid Sound ID. Use return array from _SoundOpen() or a valid file name.

---  Примечания  ---
It is recommended to open a sound file with _SoundOpen() and pass the ID array rather than use the file name in this function.  A VBR encoded file is very unlikely to return the correct position if the file name is passed directly to this function.
