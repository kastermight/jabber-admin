Enables a named pipe server process to wait for a client process to connect

$hNamedPipe
	Handle to the server end of a named pipe instance
$pOverlapped
	[опционально] Pointer to a $tagOVERLAPPED structure. If hNamedPipe was opened with $FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED,
		pOverlapped must not be 0. If hNamedPipe was created with $FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and pOverlapped is not 0, the
		$tagOVERLAPPED structure should contain a handle to a manual reset event object. If hNamedPipe was not opened
		with $FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, the function does not return until a client is connected or an error occurs.
		Successful synchronous operations result in the function returning a nonzero value if a client connects after
		the function is called.

---  Примечания  ---
If a client connects before the function is called, the function returns zero and GetLastError will return
ERROR_PIPE_CONNECTED. This can happen if a client connects in the interval between the call to CreateNamedPipe
and the call to ConnectNamedPipe. In this situation, there is a good connection between client and server even
though the function returns zero.
