Успех:	Returns 0
Ошибка:	Returns -1 if the VISA DLL could not be open or a NON ZERO value representing the VISA error code (see the VISA programmer's guide).

This function always sets @error to 1 in case of error

---  Примечания  ---
As for all the VISA functions the VISA libraries must be installed (you can check whether visa32.dll is in {WINDOWS}\system32) and a GPIB card (such as a National Instruments NI PCI-GPIB card or an Agilent 82350B PCI High-Performance GPIB card) must be installed

* For a detailed description of the most common VISA DESCRIPTORS look at the Remarks of the help on the _viExecCommand function
