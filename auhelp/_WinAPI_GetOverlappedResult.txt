$hFile
	Handle to the file, named pipe, or communications device. This is the same handle that was
		specified when the overlapped operation was started by a call to ReadFile, WriteFile, ConnectNamedPipe,
		TransactNamedPipe, DeviceIoControl, or WaitCommEvent.
$pOverlapped
	Pointer to the $tagOVERLAPPED structure that was specified when the overlapped operation was
		started.
$iBytes
	The number of bytes that were actually transferred by a read or write operation.
		For a TransactNamedPipe operation, this is the number of bytes that were read from the pipe.
		For a DeviceIoControl operation this is the number of bytes of output data returned by the device driver.
		For a ConnectNamedPipe or WaitCommEvent operation, this value is undefined.
$fWait
	[опционально] If True, the function does not return until the operation has been completed.
		If False and the operation is still pending, the function returns False and the GetLastError function will return ERROR_IO_INCOMPLETE.
