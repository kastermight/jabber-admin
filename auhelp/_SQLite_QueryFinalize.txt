---  Примечания  ---
The _SQLite_QueryFinalize function is called to delete a prepared SQL statement obtained by a previous call to _SQLite_Query. If the statement was executed successfully, or not executed at all, then SQLITE_OK is returned. If execution of the statement failed then an error code is returned. 

All prepared statements must finalized before _SQLite_Close is called or else the close will fail with a return code of SQLITE_BUSY.
